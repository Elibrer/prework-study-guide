# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

# <prework-study-guide>

## Description

This webpage has been developed as a source of information that will help with my bootcamp study. Having this page as a reference tool will be highly beneficial to my learning, as I'll be able to refer back to the relevant information when needing help, or simply just some inspiration. Further, creating and developing a site like this has already kickstarted my learning experience, and has provided a solid base to build upon in the future.
I always like having a 'cheasheet' of sorts to help with my study, so it has been beneficial being able to incorporate my pre class work into building this tool. A problem that it solves is (personally) remembering simple functions and elements off the top of my head. Referring to this so that my syntax is correct will mean I will have less debugging to sort out later. 
Developing this web page has taught me the basics of Git, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS - essential tools for furthering my skills in the industry and setting me up for success within the bootcamp course!

## Usage

The usage of this webpage is simply to provide information and tools to refer to when working with HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The information on the website can be seen as a cheatsheet reference guide, that will benefit the user when working on their own software development projects. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](Images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
